			<p> Miami is located on the very southeast of Florida. Miami is the largest city in South Florida and is the second largest in all of Florida. Visitors in Miami can go to beaches nearby, fish, Everglades, and many other outdoor activities because of the great weather. The professional sports teams in Miami are the Dolphins, Heat, Panthers, and Marlins. </p>

			<p> Tampa Bay is connected to the Gulf of Mexico and has great weather for vacations. Tampa Bay has a population of 4 million people. An interesting part about Tampa is that when there, visitors can see many large manatees swimming by in the ocean. The professional sports teams in Tampa include the Buccaneers, Lightning, and the Rays. Right now, the Rays are the best team in the MLB. Tampa Bay also has a lot of great beaches for vacation. </p>
